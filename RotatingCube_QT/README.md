## Technologies Used

- **Qt**: A powerful cross-platform application framework used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **C++**: The programming language used for implementing the core logic and functionality of the computer 3D graphics.

## How to run the project
- **Clone the project**: Get a copy of the project on your computer.

- **Open Qt Creator**: Launch Qt Creator on your computer.

- **Open Project**: Navigate to File -> Open File or Project... in the menu bar.

  - Select the folder that represents your project (it should contain your CMakeLists.txt file).
  - Click Open to load the project into Qt Creator.
- **Configure the Project**: Qt Creator will automatically detect the CMakeLists.txt file and configure the project. It may prompt 
you to select a build directory if it's the first time opening the project.

- **Build the Project**: After the project is loaded, you will see it in the Projects pane on the left side of Qt Creator.

  - If necessary, configure your build settings (like selecting a build kit or target).
  - Click on the hammer icon (Build Project) in the bottom left corner to build the project. This step compiles your code.

- **Run the Project**: Once the project is successfully built without errors, click on the green play button (or press Ctrl + R) to run the project.
